    "At fast.ai we have a distinctive [teaching philosophy](http://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/) of [\"the whole game\"](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505094653).  This is different from how most traditional math & technical courses are taught, where you have to learn all the individual elements before you can combine them (Harvard professor David Perkins call this *elementitis*), but it is similar to how topics like *driving* and *baseball* are taught.  That is, you can start driving without [knowing how an internal combustion engine works](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/thoughts-after-taking-the-deeplearning-ai-courses-8568f132153), and children begin playing baseball before they learn all the formal rules."
